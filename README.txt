2. In the second commit, a text field and a button were added.  
Then the following functionality was added: we enter text and by clicking on the button we display a message with the text entered.  
If there is no text in the field, then nothing happens by pressing the button.
Also added this text file with a description of commits and created a directory with images of the results

3. In the third commit, a second screen was created with a text box and a button.  
The second screen now opens when you click on the button on the first screen.  
In the text field of the second screen we transfer the contents of the text field of the first screen.  
By clicking on the Button, nothing happens yet.
